## Description

Tap-Tap Game is a small web app built to practice **DOM manipulation with JavaScript**, arrays, objects, event listeners, and CSS styling.  
It‚Äôs designed to be **fun and playful**, with sound effects, milestone messages, and dynamic quotes that align with each color.

---

## Features

- Random background color change on tap
- Sound effect for each tap
- Random quotes that match the color
- Milestone messages after reaching certain tap counts
- Toggle between Tap Mode and Auto Mode
- Dynamic footer showing date, time, and signature
- Smooth animations for quotes (‚Äúdance‚Äù effect)
- Mystery blend colors using random RGB

---

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (including Google Fonts)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, arrays, objects, event listeners)
- Sound effects via HTML `<audio>`

---

## How It Works

- Colors and quotes are stored as arrays/objects.
- JavaScript functions pick random colors and matching quotes.
- `textContent` updates text elements safely, while `innerHTML` can be used for styled text.
- Event listeners handle tap clicks and toggle auto mode.
- Sound plays on tap and milestones trigger alerts at certain counts.
- Footer updates dynamically every second to show date and time.
